# image-labels-generator-using-Amazon-Rekognition-
In this project, we will be building an image labels generator, using Amazon Rekognition. This is going to be a fun one. Once built, it will be able to recognize and label images. For example, if you have a photo of a cat, Amazon Recognition will be able to identify what it is, and label the image as a cat.
